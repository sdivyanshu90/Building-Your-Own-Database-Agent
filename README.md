# Building Your Own Database Agent

A hands-on course by **[DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)** in collaboration with **[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)**, designed to teach developers, data professionals, and AI enthusiasts how to create intelligent database agents powered by **Azure OpenAI Service** and orchestration frameworks like **LangChain**.

---

## üìñ Introduction

Modern businesses generate massive amounts of structured data in the form of **CSV files** and **SQL databases**. Extracting meaningful insights from these data sources often requires complex queries, technical expertise, and significant time investment.

This course - **[Building Your Own Database Agent](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-your-own-database-agent/)** - bridges that gap by enabling you to use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to interact with structured data naturally through conversational AI. By the end of the course, you‚Äôll know how to:

* Build and deploy your own **AI-powered database agents**
* Query CSV and SQL databases using **natural language**
* Leverage **Azure OpenAI Service** capabilities, including **function calling** and the **Assistants API**
* Integrate these tools with frameworks like **LangChain** for orchestration and automation

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** or a professional looking to integrate **AI assistants** into your workflow, this course provides the **practical skills** to get started.
